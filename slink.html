	<h1>Linking to Specific Places Within Documents </h1>
	<p id = "part 1">To point to an anchor in a link, use the same form of link that you would when linking
to the whole page, with the filename or URL of the page in the href attribute. After the
name of the page, however, include a hash sign (#) and the ID of the element exactly as
it appears in the id attribute of that element (including the same uppercase and lowercase
characters!), as follows:</p>
<a href="#part 2"> Jump to part2</a>


<p id = "part 2">Before browsers supported linking to elements directly using their IDs, you had to use
the name attribute of the <a> tag to create anchors on the page to which you could link.
Rather than including the href attribute in your <a> tag to link to a location, you included
